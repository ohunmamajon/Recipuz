## Key Achievements:

# MVVM Architecture: 
  I embraced the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to structure the app's codebase, enhancing maintainability and separation of concerns.

# Apple Design Guidelines: 
  Throughout the development process, I prioritized adherence to Apple's design guidelines and best practices. This focus ensured that the app not only meets the high standards set by 
  Apple but also delivers a familiar and delightful user experience.

# Seamless User Experience: 
  User experience was at the forefront of my design decisions. By crafting an intuitive user interface and incorporating user-friendly interactions, I ensured a seamless and enjoyable 
  experience for app users.

# UIKit & Code-Based UI: 
  I chose to work with UIKit, leveraging its powerful capabilities, to create the app's user interface. Adopting a code-based approach allowed me to explore a wide range of UI 
  components and tailor them to match the app's unique design requirements.
 # Continuous Learning: 
  Developing and publishing this app provided me with valuable insights into the app development lifecycle. I embraced challenges, iterated on my design, and honed my development 
  skills during the process.
